# bikelane

It's really annoying when people park in bike lanes. It's dangerous too. People should stop doing it.

[https://bikelane.app/(bikelane.app) is a way of reporting when inconsiderate drivers park in bikelanes in a structured and easy way. Put in a few basic details, upload a few quick photos and it will generate you a ready-to-go email with all the details to send to the company that owns the vehicle.

It can also send a tweet to the company telling them how important it is that their drivers don't park in bike lanes.

And depending on when you live it can also report it directly to your local council.

## Is this free?

Yes, free and open source. All the code is here on the repo.

## Does emailing companies have any impact?

It varies. The larger courier companies are pretty good about responding and offering drivers retraining when this is brought to their attention. Sure, they're companies, but they probably don't want dead cyclists any more than we do. 

## What info is stored about me?

This app doesn't ask you for any identifying information about yourself. The automated email that it generates is prepared by the app, but it's actually sent by you - the app doesn't know or store your email address.

## I run a company and I get tons of these emails about my drivers - how can I stop that happening?

Well, a really good answer is to stop your drivers parking in bike lanes.

Failing that, if you would rather that we deliver these notifications to you via a different format or an API that you have set up then we're very happy to do that.

## My council is not listed

I would love your help to add it. You can do directly this by editing the /actions/councils.json file if you know what JSON is. Or if you don't know how to do it but do know the right email for your council then please raise an issue on github with the info and I'll add manually.

## I want to contribute.

Awesome. Fork this repo and get going on improving the ui, designing a nice logo, adding functionality - whatever you can do. Send me a pull request and I'll happily merge it in once tested.

## I can't do any of that, but I do want to contribute. Do you take money?

This service is free to use. It is also not very expensive - but also not free - to run.  If you do want to buy me a coffee, a beer or some hosting then you can buy me a coffee:
